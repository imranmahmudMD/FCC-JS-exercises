Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

Note
You can return the array with its elements in any order.

=== ANSWER ===

function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  const x = arr1.filter(x => !arr2.includes(x));
  const y = arr2.filter(y => !arr1.includes(y));
  
  const difference = x.concat(y);
  return difference;
}

diffArray(["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "pink wool", "dead shrub"], ["diorite", "andesite", "grass", "dirt", "dead shrub"]);

// take one array and compare to the other item by item, if the item not found then push into new array
