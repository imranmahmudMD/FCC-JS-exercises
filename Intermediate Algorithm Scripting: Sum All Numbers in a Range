We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.

// get the min and the max numbers, run a for loop and then add each successive number (min and max inclusive) into a temp variable to cumulate the numbers. Return the temp variable

function sumAll(arr) {

let max = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1])
let min = Math.min(arr[0], arr[1])
let sumNum = 0;
for(var i = min; i <= max; i++) {
  sumNum += i;
}
return sumNum;
}

console.log(sumAll([1, 4]));
