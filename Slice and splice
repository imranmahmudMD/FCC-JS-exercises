Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice
You are given two arrays and an index.

Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.


===ANSWER===

function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {

let combined = arr2.slice();
  // console.log(combined);
  for(var i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    combined.splice(n+i,0,arr1[i]);
  }
  return combined;
}

console.log(frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1));

// copy contents of arr1 into arr2 at position n
