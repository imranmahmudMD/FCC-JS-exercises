Basic Algorithm Scripting: Find the Longest Word in a String
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.

Your response should be a number.



=== ANSWER ====

Split the string into an array each containing the words of the string, create a variable longestWord
Cycle through the array contents one by one and if the length of any array content is longer than longestWord, assign that length to longestWord. 

function findLongestWordLength(str) {

   var strSplit = str.split(" ");
      
   var longestWord = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < strSplit.length; i++){
  if(strSplit[i].length > longestWord){
    longestWord = strSplit[i].length;
  }
}
return longestWord;
}

console.log(findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"));

findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog");
